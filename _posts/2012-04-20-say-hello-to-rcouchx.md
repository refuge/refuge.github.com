title: Say hello to rcouchx!
---

rcouchx is a macosx interface for rcouch. It's adapted couchdbx-app from
Jan to rcouch, so it's now possible to administrate and distribute
rcouch as an OSX app:

You can download the binary on github:

https://github.com/downloads/refuge/rcouch/rcouchx-0.5.1.tar.gz

Or build it from the source:

    $ git clone git://github.com/refuge/rcouch.git
    $ cd rcouch && make rcouchx

Then launch `rcouchx.app` to run it.

In near future I expect to add more features to it.

Enjoy,
