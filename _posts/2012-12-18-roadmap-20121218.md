Ideas and points to be developped in the coming weeks/months.

## Attendees

+ Beno√Æt Chesneau
+ Nicolas Dufour

## Discussed points

The general idea is: Couchdb is our model, but we feel it's not enough for what we need. It's time to move on!

### blanket - document API

Document API able to manage document "a la" couchdb.

Would have to be generic enough to be able to use the following:

+ [eleveld](https://github.com/basho/eleveldb)
+ [bitcask](https://github.com/basho/bitcask)
+ [hanoidb](https://github.com/krestenkrab/hanoidb)

### attachments / blobs

Couchdb attachments are known to be badly managed.
The idea is to externalize the attachments from the .couch file with different backends.
Each attachment would also have a document related to it.

The idea is to make sure Refuge is a true document oriented database in which a blob/attachment is the document and the the "couchdb" document is the metadata associated with the blob.

Nothing forbids to have many blobs referenced by many "couchdb" documents. On the other hand, only one blob with a given content can exist in the database.

### handler replicate

CouchDB replication is a protocol first.
We should follow that protocol whatsoever so that we can replicate between:

+ Refuge <-> Refuge
+ Refuge <-> CouchdB

### Other points

#### couch_tree to revisit

And specially to see if [couch_key_tree](https://github.com/benoitc/couchdb/blob/master/src/couchdb/couch_key_tree.erl) can be salvaged. 

#### Trying to have everything in erlang

+ [jiffy](https://github.com/refuge/jiffy) -> [jsx](https://github.com/talentdeficit/jsx).
+ icu made optional or can be replaced to erlang implementation (to decide). Refs:
  + [https://github.com/erlang-unicode/ux](https://github.com/erlang-unicode/ux)
  + [https://github.com/erlang-unicode/ucol](https://github.com/erlang-unicode/ucol)
  + [https://github.com/erlang-unicode/i18n](https://github.com/erlang-unicode/i18n)

## Action items

### Generic API

API to access to the documents stored in Refuge.

application name: Blanket.

### Blob Server

The blob server is a replacement for the attachments in couchdb.
A blob is set of bytes in a given format.
It's uniquely idetifiable by a content hash set by the client.

Backends:

+ haystack
+ cloud file
+ s3

Note: Need to see how we can store the configuration (per node? per db?).

application name: TBD.

### Trust protocol

+ application name for the discovery module: beacon.
+ need to describe in details the protocol between two nodes.

	
### Web Site

+ use cases to collect and describe.
+ need to have the following sections:
  + documentation,
  + wiki,
  + blog.

### Refuge Box

+ Name: TBD.
+ Would provide a turn-key solution easily integrable in any environment:
  + run on linux with a pre-installed Refuge starting automatically
  + ARM platform
  + SSD storage
  + Wifi/USB/Ethernet
  + Would be able to listen for wireless sensors.
  + Would be able to understand I2C sensors (at some extent - to discuss).


## Dates

+ web site for Christmas 2012.
+ touch base for January 4th 2013.
+ release target date: week of January 7th 2013
